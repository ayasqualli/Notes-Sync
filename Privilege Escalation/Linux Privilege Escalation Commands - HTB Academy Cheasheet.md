- Enumerate readable only files with a grep pattern: 
```bash
find / -type f -readable -exec grep -In "HTB" {} + 2>/dev/null
```

- Finding history files
```bash
find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

## Proc
The proc filesystem ( proc / procfs) is a particular filesystem in Linux that contains information about system processes, hardware, and other system information. It is the primary way to access process information and can be used to view and modify kernel settings. It is virtual and doesn't exist as a real filesystem but is dynamically generated by the kernel. It can be used to look up system information such as the state of running processes, kernel parameters, system memory, and devices. It can also stets certain system parameters, such as process priority, scheduling and memory allocation.

```bash
find /proc -name cmdline -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"
```

## Installed Packages

```bash
apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list
```

## Trace System Calls

`strace` can be used to track and analyze system calls and signal processing. It allows us to follow the flow of the program and understand how it accesses system resources, processes signals, and receives and sends data from the operating system. in addition, we can also use the tool to monitor security-related activities and identify potential attack vectors such as specific requests to remote hosts using passwords or tokens.

```bash
strace ping -c1 <ip-address>
```

## Config Files

```bash
find / -type f \( -name *.conf -o -name *.config \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

## Scripts

```bash
find / -type f -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "src\|snap\|share"
```
